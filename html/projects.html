        <h1>MNIST Digit Classification</h1>
        <p>Explored different machine learning based approaches to classify handwritten 
            digits provided by the MNIST data set. Personally applied K-means clustering 
            and a 2-layer neural network to achieve an accuracy of 0.919 on the testing data.</p>

        <h1>Breast Cancer Analysis</h1>
        <p>Analyzed data obtained from cytological breast tissue samples to classify a 
            mass as malignant or benign. Personally performed a K-nearest neighbors, as well as 
            seven different classification trees, such as boosted trees, bagged trees and random forests.</p>
